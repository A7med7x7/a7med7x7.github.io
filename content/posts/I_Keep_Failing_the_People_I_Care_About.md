###  Things I was wrong about

Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it's hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever. 

### CRM 

when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don't do that, I just can't maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management  where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life. 

When I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself. Even though I want to check on the people I love from time to time, I just don’t do it. I just can’t maintain it; I fail every time. Recently, I came across the term _Customer Relationship Management_, where businesses keep track of their customers, and I found a video talking about applying the same idea to tracking your social life. where you keep track of customers and call when you, its just a system that companies use to remember their customers. I did my own version on [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), where I listed names of people I care about the most, but it wasn't too late until I forgot about it. All my attempts seem to fail.
