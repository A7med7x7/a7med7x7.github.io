I used to think that if someone starts thinking about "quitting something," then they are already declining, and there won't be a lot of time until they quit. Here, I'm interested in quitting things you once desired or set for yourself, out of reliable or reliable intrinsic or extrinsic motivator.

Quitting usually involves the notion of  "leaving before achieving the bare minimum you set for yourself." I never had the genuine thought of quitting something I truly loved. I've quit video editing for Electronic Sports and Anime, but I've already achieved what I wanted. So it wasn't considered "quitting". Something interesting and scary has been happening to me for around 5 months, where I started to somehow "think about quitting" just having the idea whispering in my head is scary, because the moment you start to think about it, that means there is something wrong. 

To this very day, and for the first time, I'm having thoughts of quitting what I do, especially quitting doing computer science, I mean, the road is yet to start, but I just wanted to log this feeling for later, as it has caused me some discomfort lately. Luckily, I can enumerate some factors I haven't yet organized that contribute to this thought, some are related to my environment, and I can feel it, some are related to the pace of both me and the world. 

Before unpacking this, I'm more into how to react to this recurrence of the urge; should I worry? Is it for good? How to know so? There are tons of questions that I will rely on time to help me with.
