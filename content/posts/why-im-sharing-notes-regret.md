+++

One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ahmed.alghali.524/), not consistently, and then I went through what I called _“[Manulasis](https://youtu.be/HxlPv0xI1qg?si=Zdq8THc9kZqxmiQo)”_(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.

This happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.

If I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of [regret](https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/). I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.
