title = 'The greatest tragedy in life'

I once read: 

> _“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren't there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”_

As far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value. I couldn't project myself to if I were the “people”… do people help in my life indirectly, or without them knowing? Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space. I found that sometimes people do change the way I think, talk, the frequency of doing something good, the latency of retrieving meaning from something, the hope and the discovery. Sometimes it’s crystal clear how I'm affected by their doings, other times it’s indirect; only their existence will bring every good part of me to life again. 

It really sadness me that I was loved by many, more than I thought, I recently published a video, after a long time of me being distant, people went crazy sending to me and asking how I’m, and most of them notice that I was not around recently, I was fooling my mind that social life is not important, wether you are present or not, people will forget you, in short, it is hard to admit, but there are people out there who love us more that we know.
