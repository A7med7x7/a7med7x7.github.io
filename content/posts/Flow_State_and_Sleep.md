Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.

Today, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn't comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back.  

#### 1. Sleeping early (70%)

The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally & physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.

#### 1. Waking up early(90%)

Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM

Waking up early always makes it better to concentrate
