Today I folded the first 21 years of my life, years I can’t repeat or replay. I thank Allah for blessing me to live this long. Those first 21 years were upheavals.

I grew up playing video games and memorizing/reciting Quran under the mentorship of Shiekha Entisar, my best friend’s mother. I had the chance to pursue an education. Even though I was a high performer, I scored only average on entrance exams and never paid attention to my academic pursuits during the bottleneck years that mattered the most.

Lately I learned to love my family and friends. I also learned to dislike certain kinds of people. I’ve been listening, whether I’m interested or not, because it always helps me understand more. And I’ve been keeping quiet during moments when I had so much to speak up.

I have been, and to some point still am, a generalist. I spend half of my time doing things consistently and the other half exploring new things whenever they appear. As a result of my constant consumption, I became socially awkward, developed IBS, and struggled with severe social anxiety.
