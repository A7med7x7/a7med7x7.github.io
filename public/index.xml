      <title>Five Unplanned Hours - I learned myself by watching someone else arrive</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I spent five hours talking to Awab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t planned. no intention, no emotional preparation. he texted me casually saying: &lt;em&gt;“VC in 2–3 hours?”&lt;/em&gt; the kind of message you expect to lead to small updates and shallow catching up as we usually do. Instead, it became one of the most profound conversations I’ve ever had. this piece exists to serve as an act of gratitude toward Awab, a person I realized today I’ve never properly stopped to appreciate. this is how I process affection: by intellectualizing the feelings, by writing instead about it, instead of feeling it directly, lol. If so, It captures fragments of what I learned about friendship, about myself, and about what it means to be understood without asking to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I basically &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=All%20the%20cool%20friends%20I%20could%E2%80%99ve%20made&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ruined all the friendships&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; I had since I was a kid, and it is me who is the problem, not the people, although I kept myself busy to the point where I don’t &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/state-of-numbness/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;feel it&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; most of the time, alongside guilt and fear of making new friendships. I started to drop people before &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=then%20stop%20trying.-,This%20cycle,-of%20people%20showing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the cycle&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; of me starting to get cold and avoidant begins, which would eventually ruin the friendships or relationships anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who I Am : on the Person I Failed to Define</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This question is by far the hardest for me to answer. I’ve tried for years, and every attempt was prone to failure. A big part of the struggle wasn’t just about identity itself, but about how strange my relationships were, unstable, confusing, always shifting. It’s hard to know who you are when the people around you &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=This%20cycle%20of%20people%20showing%20genuine%20interest%20in%20me%2C%20then%20suddenly%20losing%20it%2C%20is%20hard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;don’t stay long enough&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, for you to see your reflection in them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This writing sums all my previous attempts in the search for who I am. I’ve been taking notes on what I believe about myself, the frameworks I adopted, and the ways I tried to describe the person I thought I was. What you’ll read here is a reflection and a summary of those notes, up to today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember coming back to Sudan from Saudi Arabia when &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/abd.alwahab.alser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Abd Alwahab&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Learned Meaning Before I Learn Pleasure</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-learned-meaning-before-i-learn-pleasure/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a famous Viktor Frankl quote:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;“When a man can’t find a deep sense of meaning, he distracts himself with pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Franks argues that the lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits, rather than addressing the underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even for most people, this is a big issue, but there is another group that suffers from the opposite problem. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning the Truth About How I Love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of different notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There were parts of my childhood and teenage years when I found myself visiting what I now think of as &lt;em&gt;the cave of disparity&lt;/em&gt;. I was fortunate enough to find my way out. much of the credit goes to one essential shift that guided me toward stability if I my say: I stopped over-complaining about my condition and began paying attention to how my thoughts were shaping my state of being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The velocity at which I&amp;rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying &amp;ldquo;Oops&amp;rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed. This oscillating pattern of behavior has been defining the kind and amount of love I receive in this world, updating a behavior is either bringing me joy by interacting with people, loving myself, or appreciating the world, or has led me to a series of overwhelm led by the need to solve the questions I’m cornered with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that if someone starts thinking about &amp;ldquo;quitting something,&amp;rdquo; then they are already declining, and there won&amp;rsquo;t be a lot of time until they quit. Here, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in quitting things you once desired or set for yourself, out of reliable or reliable intrinsic or extrinsic motivator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;I have no clue who said this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them.&#xA;One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit.&#xA;I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-i-was-wrong-about&#34;&gt;Things I was wrong about&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it&amp;rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The greatest tragedy in life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I once read:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren&amp;rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>20</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a rainy day when I realized that I was 19 years old, and I only had a few months left to turn 20. I’m no longer becoming a teenager, just like how John Green puts it, my 20s will go fast. My 30s will go faster than I can imagine, and suddenly I’m 40.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can’t let your mind stop thinking about the future or let the things from the past stop controlling you. I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of?  Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Forgetting Too Easily</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom, I was cleaning my contacts, renaming, deleting, reorganizing. I probably should be responding to people instead, but that also feels like work, lol. While scrolling through, I found the contact of this guy who helped me for several days to get my driver’s license. I barely remember his face or his name, but I remember how genuinely helpful he was. he’s Waqas’s cousin our neighbor. I haven’t remembered either of them since the war started, maybe even from before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning Faliure Modes - Branching</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series of notes I’m taking to understand the person I am when learning something. Most of them are about understanding myself and applying useful techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading about neuroscience can help me save time instead of experimenting blindly and trying to see what works. But it feels almost too late, as I spent the first 19 years of my life learning how to learn. I never even signed up for the famous Coursera course on this topic. It was a lonely experimentation road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning Faliure Modes - Floating Information</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/learning-faliure-modes-floating-information/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I call this problem &lt;em&gt;floating information&lt;/em&gt;. It is a literal translation of the Arabic word &amp;ldquo;طائفة&amp;rdquo;, which means floating in space without connection. I first noticed that there is information that is not linked to anything. It has no context, it solves no problem, and this kind of information is the hardest to keep in my mind. I forget it very easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ahmed.alghali.524/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, not consistently, and then I went through what I called &lt;em&gt;“&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HxlPv0xI1qg?si=Zdq8THc9kZqxmiQo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manulasis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;”&lt;/em&gt;(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman&amp;rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you&amp;rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that&amp;rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says:  no they aren&amp;rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Lack of Real Feedback</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;progress&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don&amp;rsquo;t know about me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
