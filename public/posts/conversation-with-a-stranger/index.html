        <p>Recently, I was in a meeting, and after the official hours ended, members usually stayed to catch up and chat a bit. one girl came up with a random question. It was something like: <em>what is something a stranger has told you that stuck with you?</em> It wasn’t too long until that moment that I realized I actually had one.</p>
<p>I remember that day in my life very clearly, and I still remember it often. The fact that I keep revisiting that day every now and then means it was profound to me. I don’t want to forget it. I already forgot the stranger I met and the exact dialogue, but I never forgot how he made me feel. unfortunately, only parts of it still live in my memory, and they get blurrier as I grow up. Still, I will say what I am able to remember.</p>
<p>The context of me at that time was that I was maybe fifteen or sixteen. I was very pessimistic, and I didn’t love that part of my life very much. I had no one around me to sit down with me and tell me some real shit that I needed to hear about life, goals, wounds, healing, and the importance of having a degree. Just some random real talk you would say to your kid when you feel he is lost. I was lost, but I never made a sign that I was. I never asked for help.</p>
<p>I had friends whom I used to walk with back home from high school. I would stop at a bus station so they could take a bus, and from there I was the only one whose home was within walking distance, so I usually walked alone. that time, I remember there was a man in his stopped van. he used it as a transportation vichle, but either he was waiting for something or he was waiting in a queue for gas. we used to have gas scarcity back in Sudan. I don’t remember the exact series of actions that led to me and the man talking to each other in the first place, but I remember that most of the conversation happened after he invited me into his car. I set in the front seat with him, and the man started to talk.</p>
<p>he was light skinned, with white hair and a beard, very respectful. he wasn’t talking nonsense. he didn’t seem like someone who usually talk, because the kind of conversation we had was a bit odd for something you would find in public. we talked about high school and university, and he told me how important it is to get a degree. It’s not that I had started to lose faith in the educational system, but I needed to hear this. he held a degree himself. I can’t remember in what major, but he told me it was the reason why he was intellectual compared to the environment around him.</p>
<p>he then shifted to some real life lessons he had learned. they were not nonsense, and maybe for the first time, I had sat down with an elderly person and didn’t feel the need to filter what he was saying. I had spoken with many elderly people before, and with basic teenage critical thinking, I could usually filter a lot of nonsense and a desire to just talk. but this time was different.</p>
<p>Then he randomly started talking about how to overcome challenges and how great things might be waiting on the other side. I remember I felt present during the conversation. I knew what I was experiencing. I knew it was something I really wanted to hear someone talking about, to me, I absorbed every word he said and listened carefully. what he said stuck with me because I needed to hear something like that, and it came from a bus driver, a stranger I had never met before and never met again.</p>
<p>I managed to get his phone number and name. He resided in a nearby neighborhood. The name is now lost among many others in my notes. I had a very bad note-taking system, so I can’t know which name and phone number belonged to him. I thought of visiting him when I entered university, but I didn’t.</p>
