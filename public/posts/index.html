                    <p><p>Today, I spent five hours talking to Awab.</p>
<p>It wasn’t planned. no intention, no emotional preparation. he texted me casually saying: <em>“VC in 2–3 hours?”</em> the kind of message you expect to lead to small updates and shallow catching up as we usually do. Instead, it became one of the most profound conversations I’ve ever had. this piece exists to serve as an act of gratitude toward Awab, a person I realized today I’ve never properly stopped to appreciate. this is how I process affection: by intellectualizing the feelings, by writing instead about it, instead of feeling it directly, lol. If so, It captures fragments of what I learned about friendship, about myself, and about what it means to be understood without asking to be.</p></p>

<p>This writing sums all my previous attempts in the search for who I am. I’ve been taking notes on what I believe about myself, the frameworks I adopted, and the ways I tried to describe the person I thought I was. What you’ll read here is a reflection and a summary of those notes, up to today.</p></p>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/abd.alwahab.alser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abd Alwahab</a>
 told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.</p></p>

                    <p><blockquote>
<p>There is a famous Viktor Frankl quote:<br>
<em>“When a man can’t find a deep sense of meaning, he distracts himself with pleasure.”</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Franks argues that the lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits, rather than addressing the underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even for most people, this is a big issue, but there is another group that suffers from the opposite problem. </p></p>

<p>your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.</p></p>
