      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for people to present themselves as they are, which is messy, because to present yourself as perfect sets up an unfair standard for other people to live by.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Simon Sinek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don’t know about real loss, because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Sean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but I have never revised the list since a while&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get asked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don&amp;rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
