      <description>&lt;p&gt;I basically &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=All%20the%20cool%20friends%20I%20could%E2%80%99ve%20made&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ruined all the friendships&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; I had since I was a kid, and it is me who is the problem, not the people, although I kept myself busy to the point where I don’t &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/state-of-numbness/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;feel it&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; most of the time, alongside guilt and fear of making new friendships. I started to drop people before &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=then%20stop%20trying.-,This%20cycle,-of%20people%20showing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the cycle&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; of me starting to get cold and avoidant begins, which would eventually ruin the friendships or relationships anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who I Am : on the Person I Failed to Define</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This question is by far the hardest for me to answer. I’ve tried for years, and every attempt was prone to failure. A big part of the struggle wasn’t just about identity itself, but about how strange my relationships were, unstable, confusing, always shifting. It’s hard to know who you are when the people around you &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a7med7x7.github.io/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/#:~:text=This%20cycle%20of%20people%20showing%20genuine%20interest%20in%20me%2C%20then%20suddenly%20losing%20it%2C%20is%20hard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;don’t stay long enough&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, for you to see your reflection in them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This writing sums all my previous attempts in the search for who I am. I’ve been taking notes on what I believe about myself, the frameworks I adopted, and the ways I tried to describe the person I thought I was. What you’ll read here is a reflection and a summary of those notes, up to today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Learned Meaning Before I Learn Pleasure</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-learned-meaning-before-i-learn-pleasure/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a famous Viktor Frankl quote:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;“When a man can’t find a deep sense of meaning, he distracts himself with pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Franks argues that the lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits, rather than addressing the underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even for most people, this is a big issue, but there is another group that suffers from the opposite problem. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for people to present themselves as they are, which is messy, because to present yourself as perfect sets up an unfair standard for other people to live by.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Simon Sinek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t know about real loss, because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Sean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get asked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don&amp;rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
