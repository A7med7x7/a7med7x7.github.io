      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Calderon: I don&amp;rsquo;t know but..whenever we happen to meet you&amp;rsquo;re always helping people and smiling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arthur: You&amp;rsquo;re too smart for me sister..I guess I..I&amp;rsquo;m afraid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sister Calderon: There is nothing to be afraid of mister Morgan. Take a gamble that love exists and do a loving act.  Perhaps you could help somebody, helping makes you really happy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a friend whom I met online, he suffered from social anxiety, he would tell me how he panic from the idea of going to the university, I knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying but a part of me couldn&amp;rsquo;t just believe it, that how a psychological disorder can control you this much, you just need to stop overthinking that people will hurt you and there is no reason to be afraid and call it a day! yes, I was ignorant I tried to convince him to change something he can&amp;rsquo;t, that he can overcome this and these are only voices in his heads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
