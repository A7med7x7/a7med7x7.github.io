      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a friend whom I met online, he suffered from social anxiety, he would tell me how he panic from the idea of going to the university, I knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying but a part of me couldn&amp;rsquo;t just believe it, that how a psychological disorder can control you this much, you just need to stop overthinking that people will hurt you and there is no reason to be afraid and call it a day! yes, I was ignorant I tried to convince him to change something he can&amp;rsquo;t, that he can overcome this and these are only voices in his heads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;do things badly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I&amp;rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
