## About

This repository contains the source code and content for my personal blog, a space for documenting experiments, reflections, and thoughts that don’t fit neatly into one category.  
Some posts are fragments from old notebooks, others are fresh reflections or field reports from my technical explorations.

## Categories

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Field Notes** | Technical experiments, ML research logs, and engineering explorations. |
| **Reflections** | Personal insights/emotional or philosophical observations. |
| **Letters & Fables** | Creative pieces, stories, metaphors, and imagined dialogues. |
| **Thought** | Conceptual and abstract explorations about meaning, reason, and existence. |
| **Archives** | Notes written before building this blog, independent observations that were never shared publicly. These are rediscovered writings that still resonate today. |
| **Unfinished Notes/Drafts** | Unfinished writings or drafts that I never completed. These serve as evidence of attempts to express ideas, even if I failed to articulate them fully. |
| **Meta** | Notes about writing, process, and how this blog evolves. |
